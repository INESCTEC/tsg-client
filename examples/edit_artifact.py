Example - Edit an artifact from your connector

Last update: 2024-02-02

This request edits an artifact on a custom connector using a connection to the connector.
It uses a pre-established connection from the examples  request to our connector.

The following operations are demonstrated:

    1. Load environment variables (your connector configs) from a `.env` file.
    2. Establish a connection to your TSG connector.
    3. Edits an artifact from your connector.


Important:

    - Ensure that the required environment variables (Your Connector `API_KEY`, `CONNECTOR_ID`, `ACCESS_URL` and `AGENT_ID`) are set in the .env file before using this  request.
    - The connector `API_KEY` can be retrieved by loging into the TSG connector UI and navigating to the 'API Keys' tab.

Execute the code below to publish a data artifact on your connector.

Ensure that the required parameters are specified before executing the request:

    - artifact_id: Id of the artifact.
    - artifact_path: The path to the data artifact.
    - artifact_description: The description of the data artifact.
    - artifact_title: The title of the data artifact.
    - contract_offer_path: The path to the contract offer file.

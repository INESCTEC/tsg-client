Example - Get self-descriptions of an external connector

Last update: 2024-01-27

This  request retrieves and prints information about an external connector's
 self-description using a connection to a custom connector. It loads
 external connector configs from a 'EXTERNAL_CONNECTOR' variable,
 establishes a connection to your TSG connector, and then retrieves and
 prints the self-description information from the external connector.

The following operations are demonstrated:

    1. Load environment variables (your connector configs) from a `.env` file.
    2. Establish a connection to your TSG connector.
    3. Retrieve and print information about external connector self-descriptions

Important:

    - Ensure that the required environment variables (Your Connector `API_KEY`, `CONNECTOR_ID`, `ACCESS_URL` and `AGENT_ID`) are set in the .env file before using this  request.

    - The connector `API_KEY` can be retrieved by loging into the TSG connector UI and navigating to the 'API Keys' tab.

Execute the code below to request the self-description of an external connector.
